    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 22, 2025</p>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <strong>TL;DR:</strong> Comedy Set Organizer collects zero data. Everything stays on your device. We can't see your jokes, recordings, or anything else because it never leaves your phone.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
    <p>
        Comedy Set Organizer is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your creative work is personal, 
        and we believe it should stay that way.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>We collect exactly zero data.</strong> This isn't a technicality or a loophole—the app 
        literally does not have the capability to send data anywhere. There are no servers, no analytics, 
        no tracking, and no telemetry.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    <p>Everything you create in Comedy Set Organizer is stored locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Jokes:</strong> Stored in your device's SwiftData database</li>
        <li><strong>Set Lists:</strong> Stored in your device's SwiftData database</li>
        <li><strong>Recordings:</strong> Saved as audio files in your app's Documents directory</li>
        <li><strong>Notes:</strong> Stored alongside your recordings in SwiftData</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        None of this data is ever transmitted to us or anyone else unless you explicitly choose to 
        share it using iOS's built-in share sheet.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Microphone Access</h2>
    <p>
        The app requests access to your device's microphone, but only for a specific purpose: 
        recording your comedy sets when you tap the "Record" button. The microphone is never accessed 
        without your explicit action, and recordings are saved directly to your device.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can revoke microphone access at any time through iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Microphone. 
        This will prevent new recordings but won't affect any other features of the app.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Sharing Your Content</h2>
    <p>
        The app includes a share button for recordings, which uses iOS's native share sheet. This allows 
        you to send recordings via AirDrop, Messages, email, or other apps <em>at your discretion</em>. 
        We have no involvement in or knowledge of what you share.
    </p>
    
    <h2>No Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Comedy Set Organizer does not integrate with any third-party services, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No analytics services (like Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.)</li>
        <li>No crash reporting tools</li>
        <li>No advertising networks</li>
        <li>No cloud storage services</li>
        <li>No social media integrations</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>iCloud Sync</h2>
    <p>
        The app <strong>does not</strong> use iCloud sync. This is an intentional design decision to 
        keep your data entirely under your control and on your device only.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights and Control</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Delete individual items:</strong> Swipe to delete jokes, set lists, or recordings within the app</li>
        <li><strong>Delete all data:</strong> Delete the app from your device to permanently remove all data</li>
        <li><strong>Export/backup:</strong> Use iOS's built-in backup features (iTunes or Finder) to backup app data</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        Comedy Set Organizer does not collect data from anyone, including children under 13. The app 
        is rated 4+ and contains no objectionable content.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
        Your data's security is ensured by iOS's built-in sandboxing and security features. The app 
        cannot access data from other apps, and other apps cannot access this app's data without 
        your explicit action (like using the share sheet).
    </p>
    <p>
        We recommend setting a passcode on your device to prevent unauthorized physical access.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        If we ever change our privacy practices (which would require fundamentally changing how the 
        app works), we'll update this policy and the "Last updated" date above. Any changes would 
        be announced in app update notes.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Open Source Transparency</h2>
    <p>
        We encourage technically-inclined users to inspect the app's behavior. The app uses standard 
        iOS frameworks (SwiftUI, SwiftData, AVFoundation) and contains no obfuscated or hidden code.
    </p>

    <h2>Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>
        This app complies with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apple's App Store Review Guidelines</li>
        <li>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - No data collected = automatic compliance</li>
